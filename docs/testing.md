# Testing

Build portable downloads with `python3 scripts/package-docs-examples.py
published/docs/downloads`, then run `npm test`. Creator-kit tests run on Windows
and Linux; native-host tests use controlled test executables, not the live overlay.
Website rendering and browser isolation tests belong to the separate web repository.

Run the packaging and admission checks:

```sh
tests/admission-store-smoke.sh
tests/ci-admission-smoke.sh
tests/catalog-stage-smoke.sh
cargo test -p marketplace-tool --locked
node --test tests/warframe-market/market.test.mjs
cargo run -p marketplace-tool --locked -- package widgets/warframe-market /tmp/warframe-market.ocpkg
cargo run -p marketplace-tool --locked -- inspect /tmp/warframe-market.ocpkg
```

The CLI package tests also verify that PlayerVox listings declare MIT and the
complete MIT notice is carried inside each validated `.ocpkg`.

These prove strict manifest/listing validation, inventory, native executable
rejection, optional browser-WASM admission, deterministic ZIP bytes, durable
receipt-last ingestion with exclusive admission, bounded reads that reject
special files, catalog search over 3840 structured items, and controller/query
state across view and controller restart. Warframe tests also cover reversed
response order, failed refresh with a valid cache, messages during startup,
and IndexedDB transaction aborts after a successful request. They do not prove
live compositor or game behavior.

The catalog-stage smoke removes the temporary build outputs after admission,
then proves that the CLI can produce a signed development catalog and the exact
content-addressed `.ocpkg` from the independently verified private store. Rust
tests verify the Ed25519 signature against the compiled development public key,
reject another seed, and cover the envelope, listing, manifest, URL, size, and
digest contract.

The admission smoke uses real temporary Git revisions. It proves that an
undeclared file present only in the proposed revision is rejected, that a valid
proposal emits a receipt v2 bound to its revision, tree, identity, version, and
the SHA-256 and byte length of its package and listing, and that tests from an
exact trusted push cannot be silently skipped. Pull-request admission never
executes proposed JavaScript or build scripts; it validates and packages those
bytes with the tool compiled from the target-base commit. Push admission runs
the now-trusted revision's
Rust and Warframe Market tests once. The Ubuntu CI runner installs
the distribution's Node package before these checks: the runner's preinstalled
Node lives under a writable directory and is intentionally rejected by the
system-Node resolver. The smoke is repeated only
on trusted pushes because pull requests cannot modify the CI trust boundary.
When a private accepted store is explicitly supplied, the smoke also proves
that the exact package and listing remain independently verifiable after the
driver's temporary artifact directory has been removed. Package or same-size
listing tampering, unreceipted files, same-version replacement, and downgrade
are covered by the Rust admission tests.

Production retirement tests cover explicit removal of a superseded verified
version, the resulting signed inventory, and rejection of unknown, duplicate,
current, unreplaced, suspended, revoked, or conflicting removals without state
mutation.

Production tests cover offline preparation, detached signature verification,
sequence reservations, interrupted finalization, and retained version statuses.
The public CLI smoke rejects untrusted signatures against the compiled production
key. Private signing remains external; the generic maintainer sandbox is still
pending. Catalog publication and OverCrow runtime reuse admitted bytes and never
rerun their tests.
