# Production Marketplace Operations

This runbook is the sole operational source of truth for production
publication. It defines preparation and review of the public trust change; it
does not authorize a push, deployment, or publication.

## 1. Current product

OverCrow Marketplace admits Web API v1 extensions only: a web directory,
`manifest.json`, `listing.json`, and a deterministic stored-zip `.ocpkg`
from `marketplace-tool package`. WIT, Wasmtime, native widgets, and
provider graphs are retired.

`published/marketplace/v1/` contains the signed Web API v1 catalog with Warframe
Market 2.0.5 under MIT. Superseded packages and native-era previews are no longer
published. Further retirement requires explicit authorization after the
replacement catalog has been verified. Website-only updates preserve that
subtree byte-for-byte and do not rotate keys. The private web repository mirrors
these bytes and owns the complete `published/` website served by Coolify.

## 2. Preconditions and role separation

Use separate clean worktrees and roles: contributors submit candidate PRs;
hosted CI materializes the exact proposed tree and produces ephemeral package
digests without executing its code; a maintainer reviews and ingests the exact
trusted revision into a private store; acceptance merges only to `candidate`; an
offline publisher prepares exact catalog bytes and verifies a detached signature; and a separate deployment
operator configures Coolify to serve tracked output. The hosted receipt is
evidence for review, not a durable accepted artifact and not publication
authority. Coolify, GitHub, CI, and project temporary files never receive
production authority material.

The current ingestion path accepts only an exact trusted push and its committed
built web files. It does not execute extension-defined build commands. A future
generic maintainer sandbox is a separate milestone.

The fixed production origin is
`https://overcrow.playervox.com/marketplace/v1/`. A production catalog is valid
for exactly 90 days: republish by day 60, on every content change, and
immediately for a signed security suspension or revocation. An older sequence
is never republished as a rollback.

## 3. Repository visibility and GitHub rulesets

This repository remains public for creator access and static admission's public
Git fetches. The website is hosted independently from its private repository.
Treat this repository and every pull request as untrusted publication inputs.
Keep the existing technical and human-review rulesets on `candidate` and
`main`. `candidate` must not change `published/`.

## 4. Local admission (no publication)

Run the fast repository checks during development:

```sh
tests/admission-store-smoke.sh
tests/ci-admission-smoke.sh
tests/catalog-stage-smoke.sh
cargo test -p marketplace-tool --locked
node --test tests/warframe-market/market.test.mjs
cargo run -p marketplace-tool --locked -- package widgets/warframe-market /tmp/warframe-market.ocpkg
cargo run -p marketplace-tool --locked -- inspect /tmp/warframe-market.ocpkg
```

For a reviewed, clean, already trusted revision, persist the packages produced
by the same test/package pass into a private store outside all repositories:

```sh
repository=/absolute/path/to/a/clean/marketplace-checkout
private_parent=/absolute/private/path/to/admission-work
accepted_store=/absolute/private/path/to/accepted-store
/usr/bin/install -d -m 0700 -- "$private_parent" "$accepted_store"
revision=$(/usr/bin/git -C "$repository" rev-parse --verify 'HEAD^{commit}')
test -z "$(/usr/bin/git -C "$repository" status --porcelain=v1 --untracked-files=all)"
(
  CDPATH='' cd -- "$repository"
  sh scripts/ci-verify.sh \
    "$repository" "$revision" "$revision" push \
    Valhallab/playervox-overcrow-releases candidate \
    Valhallab/playervox-overcrow-releases candidate \
    "$private_parent" admission "$accepted_store"
)
review_tree=$(/usr/bin/git -C "$repository" rev-parse --verify "$revision^{tree}")
cargo run --manifest-path "$repository/tools/marketplace-tool/Cargo.toml" \
  -p marketplace-tool --locked -- verify-admission \
  --store "$accepted_store" --review-tree "$review_tree"
```

The driver runs the trusted revision's Rust and JavaScript tests once, packages
each widget once, and passes those admission outputs directly to
`marketplace-tool ingest`. Ingestion re-inspects the `.ocpkg`; it never executes,
repackages, or retests it. The store contains only:

```text
accepted-store/
├── admissions/<review-tree>.tsv
├── listings/<extension-id>/<version>/<sha256>.json
└── packages/<extension-id>/<version>/<sha256>.ocpkg
```

Package, listing, and receipt files are committed with synchronized temporary
files and atomic no-replace hard links. A receipt is written only after every
referenced package and listing is durable, so an interrupted attempt may leave
harmless content-addressed bytes but never a completed admission. Exact replay
is idempotent. Ingestion holds an exclusive lock on the private store directory
through policy validation and receipt verification. A concurrent ingestion
fails immediately; retry after the current ingestion finishes. No lock file
needs removal after an interrupted process. A completed same-version package or listing with different bytes,
and any downgrade, are rejected. Recovery uses the last verified completed
receipt or a fresh private store; do not edit a receipt, listing, or package in
place.

Receipts expose Git object IDs, extension IDs, versions, package/listing sizes,
and digests. Packages and listings expose the reviewed public extension bytes.
The store contains no private key, token, user data, extension storage, catalog
sequence, or deploy credential, but its path and contents still remain private
operator data.

These commands prove that candidate bytes cannot be replaced by base bytes,
that trusted push tests execute, and that admitted bytes survive temporary-work
cleanup. If hosted admission cannot produce an exact-tree receipt, stop
accepting candidate changes; do not fall back to the base checkout. Nothing in
this section signs a catalog, touches `published/`, or deploys Coolify.

To exercise the complete local contract after admission, create a fresh private
serve tree and stage a development catalog. The command accepts only the
repository's intentionally public development fixture key and fixed loopback
origin; it cannot create a production catalog.

```sh
serve_root=/absolute/private/path/to/development-marketplace
development_output="$serve_root/marketplace/v1"
generated_at=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
expires_at=$(date -u -d '+30 days' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
/usr/bin/install -d -m 0700 -- "$serve_root" "$development_output"
cargo run --manifest-path "$repository/tools/marketplace-tool/Cargo.toml" \
  -p marketplace-tool --locked -- stage-development-catalog \
  --store "$accepted_store" --review-tree "$review_tree" \
  --output "$development_output" --sequence 1 \
  --generated-at "$generated_at" --expires-at "$expires_at" \
  --signing-key "$repository/fixtures/keys/development-ed25519.key"
python3 -m http.server 8787 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory "$serve_root"
```

Use current canonical UTC timestamps and a positive sequence for an actual
manual run. The expiry must follow generation by no more than 90 days. The
output directory must be empty, private, and owned by the caller. Staging first
re-verifies the completed receipt, listing, manifest, package size, and digest;
it copies package bytes without rebuilding and commits `catalog.json` last.
Starting the loopback server is a foreground local test action, not a deploy.

## 5. Prepare and finalize production output offline

Production uses two independent commands. Neither command accepts a private key,
contacts a server, starts a signer, edits `published/`, or deploys output. The
production public key and key ID are compiled from
`keys/overcrow-production-2026-01.pub`; the origin is fixed to
`https://overcrow.playervox.com/marketplace/v1/`. Development keys and loopback
URLs cannot authorize finalization.

Keep four distinct private directories outside Git working trees: the accepted
store, publication state, prepared tree, and finalized output. The previous
finalized output is another separate directory. Each root must already exist,
be canonical, owned by the operator, and mode `0700`. Every ancestor must be
a real directory owned by root or the operator. Group- or world-writable
ancestors require the sticky bit; every child along that path must still be
owned by root or the operator. This permits protected temporary roots such as
`/tmp` and `/var/tmp`, but rejects replaceable paths under ordinary shared
directories. Symlink components are rejected. Output starts empty;
repeating the same operation may reuse only its exact matching files. Extra,
modified, or linked output files are rejected. Do not put another output or the
publication state inside one of these roots.

### Initial Web API v1 migration

The historical native-era snapshot is not an accepted Web API v1 previous
output. Before the first preparation, independently establish the highest
production sequence ever signed from the verified production catalog and the
offline publisher's records. Set `previousSequence` to that high-water mark,
including any later sequence reserved by an interrupted publication. Set
`sequence` to exactly that number plus one. Do not guess, default to zero, or
use an expired downloaded catalog as proof of the latest sequence. If the
high-water mark cannot be established, stop publication and recover the offline
records. Initial bootstrap is an explicit operator assertion; the tool cannot
infer prior production history from an empty state directory.

The first preparation omits `--previous-output`. It creates a Web API v1 output
from the selected accepted receipt. It does not import legacy manifests,
previews, or archives. The separate deployment operator preserves historical
package URLs during initial migration. Later removal requires explicit
authorization and verification that the replacement signed catalog no longer
references those objects.

### Preparation

Create a small request outside the checkout, for example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "sequence": 43,
  "previousSequence": 42,
  "generatedAt": "2026-09-05T12:00:00Z",
  "statuses": []
}
```

Those sequence numbers and time are illustrative. Use the independently
confirmed high-water mark and the current canonical UTC time
(`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Expiration is calculated as exactly 90 days after
`generatedAt`; future generation and already expired requests are rejected.

For the initial migration, run:

```sh
cargo run -p marketplace-tool --locked -- prepare-production-catalog \
  --store "$accepted_store" --review-tree "$review_tree" \
  --state "$publication_state" --request "$request_json" \
  --output "$prepared_output"
```

For every subsequent release, append
`--previous-output "$previous_finalized_output"`. It must contain a completed
production-signed Web API v1 catalog from this tool, with the fixed origin,
90-day lifetime and `preview: null`, plus its exact package inventory. An expired
previous catalog may be used as authenticated history, but a new preparation
must have a current validity window. Its envelope digest must match the last
signature recorded in publication state. The tool does not accept native-era
or arbitrary third-party catalog layouts through this option.

Preparation verifies the admitted receipt, listings and archives, then writes
`payload.json` and `packages/<id>/<version>/<sha256>.ocpkg`; it commits
`preparation.json` last. Review the exact payload and its SHA-256, including
sequence, times, identities, versions, permissions, licenses and statuses.
Do not reformat or edit prepared bytes.

New admitted versions receive `verified` status. Prior `(id, version)` entries
and packages are retained, including old versions no longer offered by the
current receipt. Same-version replacement, listing substitution and downgrade
are rejected. Use explicit status changes for withdrawal or security action:

```json
"statuses": [
  {"id": "com.example.widget", "version": "1.2.3", "status": "revoked"}
]
```

Allowed statuses are `verified`, `security-suspended` and `revoked`. Suspension
persists until an explicit change lifts it. Revocation is permanent for that
version; a later admitted version can be verified independently. Omission from
a request never removes an old status, version or archive. There is no automatic
withdrawal-by-absence or garbage collector.

For an explicitly authorized retirement, add `removeVersions` to the request:

```json
"removeVersions": [
  {"id": "com.example.widget", "version": "1.2.3"}
]
```

This optional list is bounded to 500 unique entries. A removal must identify an
existing verified version absent from the selected admission. That admission
must supply a strictly newer version of the same widget which remains verified
in the resulting catalog. Versions listed in `statuses` cannot also be removed;
revoked and suspended history cannot be erased. Unknown, duplicate, current,
unreplaced, and conflicting removals fail before reserving a sequence.

Preparation omits the retired target and archive from the new output, while
keeping the predecessor and operator state intact. Finalize and verify the new
signed catalog before deleting the retired public files. Keep private recovery
copies of the predecessor; never rewind the sequence or reuse its signature.

After deployment, verify the replacement bytes and the retired public URLs.
If the CDN still serves a deleted object, purge only that retired URL and
confirm it returns HTTP 404 or 410. A Git deletion alone does not clear caches.

### Detached signature and finalization

Transfer the exact `payload.json` bytes and their reviewed digest to the separate
authorized offline signing process. Request an Ed25519 signature over those raw
bytes, without prehashing or JSON normalization. Bring back only the raw 64-byte
signature file. The private key remains in that external signing process; do
not copy it into a checkout, prepared tree, tool argument, CI job or log.

```sh
cargo run -p marketplace-tool --locked -- finalize-production-catalog \
  --prepared "$prepared_output" --state "$publication_state" \
  --signature "$detached_signature" --output "$finalized_output"
```

Finalization checks the reservation, prepared marker, canonical payload, current
expiry, exact package bytes and detached signature against the compiled
production public key. It copies the archives, persists the verified envelope
digest in publication state, and commits `catalog.json` last. Output contains
only `catalog.json` and its complete content-addressed package tree. Successful
finalization prepares a deployable artifact; it does not deploy or grant approval
to deploy it. Review and authorize that external action separately.

### State, concurrency, and recovery

Publication state contains one private atomically replaced `state.json`: the
highest reserved sequence, exact payload digest, validity window, previous
catalog digest and, after signature verification, completed envelope digest.
It contains no private key or signature authority. Retain and back it up outside
repositories together with the last finalized output. Deleting or restoring an
older state file can discard anti-rollback knowledge; never do that as routine
recovery.

Both commands hold a nonblocking exclusive directory lock on state and output.
A concurrent operation fails immediately. Retry once the current operation has
finished; there is no stale lock file to delete. Exact replay is idempotent,
but another payload cannot reuse a sequence and an older preparation cannot be
finalized after the high-water mark advances.

After an interruption, repeat the same request and output to complete the exact
matching files. The admission bytes and previous finalized tree must remain
available when repeating preparation. If an output contains a damaged file,
use a new empty private output with the same state and request; do not edit the
state or sign modified prepared bytes. Finalization can resume after its
signature digest was recorded but before `catalog.json` became visible. The
next preparation requires that recovered signed output as its predecessor.
An unsigned reservation must be completed before another sequence is prepared;
once its 90-day validity has expired, a new request may reserve the next sequence
using the last completed predecessor. Expired signatures remain unusable.

The tool bounds a request to 128 KiB, payload to 700 KiB, envelope to 1 MiB,
catalog to 500 version entries, and each archive to 128 MiB. Inventory traversal
is limited to 2,004 entries and four levels. Archives are validated and copied
one at a time, never accumulated in memory. Retention can consume up to
62.5 GiB on disk per complete tree at the archive/count limits; allow space for
both prepared and finalized copies. Reaching a retention limit stops publication.
Use only the explicit retirement policy above for eligible superseded versions;
security history and sequence state must remain intact.

## 6. Keys and authority material

Production private keys, monotonic state and recovery backups stay outside the
repository. The old WASM-era and generic source-bundle publishers remain
retired. The development stager remains restricted to its public fixture key
and loopback origin. Production preparation/finalization has a separate entry
point and never imports or reads private signing material.

## 7. Public distribution and website deployment

This repository owns signed distribution bytes. After separately authorized
publication, mirror the complete `published/marketplace/v1/` inventory into the
private `playervox-overcrow-web` repository without changing any bytes. Its
maintainer verifies signatures, package hashes, sequence, and expiry before
committing the output. The public serving location remains
`https://overcrow.playervox.com/marketplace/v1/`.

Website-only changes happen in that private repository. They preserve the
signed distribution and require no new signature. Its static `published/`
output is served by Coolify; a GitHub merge alone is not deployment evidence.
Verify public responses after deployment. Do not purge caches as a substitute
for comparing deployed bytes.

Desktop application releases and `docs/channels/` are a separate distribution
flow. Changing widget tools or catalogs does not authorize changing them.
This document does not authorize a push, key rotation, signature, or deployment.
