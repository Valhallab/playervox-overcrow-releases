# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue or publish a proof-of-concept exploit for an
unresolved vulnerability. Use
[GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/Valhallab/playervox-overcrow-releases/security/advisories/new)
to contact Valhallab SASU privately and identify this marketplace as the
affected project. Include the affected revision, impact, environment, and the
smallest safe reproduction. Never include user data, credentials, production
keys, or extension private storage.

Coordinated disclosure is appreciated. The project does not currently offer a
bug bounty or guarantee a response deadline.

## Submission and publication boundary

Community pull requests run in CI with split, minimal permissions. The
verification job has only `contents: read`; its automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not
persisted by checkout. Two separate jobs have no checkout or content access and
receive only `statuses: write` to report the base-specific admission context on
the exact reviewed pull-request head. No repository or organization secret,
signing key, deployment credential, production sequence state, or other
publication authority is passed to a job step. Creators never receive signing
authority. Automation is evidence for a separate human review, and acceptance
into `candidate` does not publish a package. Production signing and promotion
remain offline maintainer operations against an exact reviewed revision.

The hosted `pull_request_target` job definition comes from the default branch,
not from the proposed revision. It fetches the exact pull-request head through
the fixed public repository URL as a Git object, verifies its expected digest,
and prepares its validator and drivers from the exact target-base commit. A
base-built planner compares every materialized regular file with the proposed
Git tree's mode, size, object ID, and portable path, so archive attributes
cannot omit or rewrite proposed bytes. The proposed tree is treated only as
data and is never selected as the Actions checkout or a shell-script source.

Admission validates listing metadata, the strict Web API v1 manifest, and its
complete file ledger with the base-built `marketplace-tool`, packages every
widget directory once, then inspects the stored-zip `.ocpkg`. A machine-readable
receipt v2 binds the trust revision, proposed revision, proposed tree, source
directory, extension identity, version, and the SHA-256 and byte length of both
the package and validated listing. No proposed JavaScript, build command, test,
Cargo manifest, or shell script is
executed by `pull_request_target`. Browser WebAssembly is allowed only as
verified page code. Declared regular assets are not constrained by an arbitrary
suffix allowlist: OverCrow assigns known Web MIME types and serves other data
as `application/octet-stream` with content sniffing disabled. Same-bundle reads
remain on the verified private scheme; external browser HTTP(S) is denied. WIT,
Wasmtime, native executable modules, native suffixes or signatures, and
provider graphs are rejected. Push CI executes the exact now-trusted revision's
Rust and JavaScript tests once. Only that trusted-push mode may receive an
explicit private accepted-store path. It re-inspects and commits the already
produced package and listing bytes under their identity, version, and SHA-256,
then writes the exact-revision receipt last. Incomplete artifacts have no
receipt and are not accepted. The generic sandbox for extension-defined build
or test commands is not implemented; publication must copy admitted bytes
without rebuilding or retesting them.

Development catalog staging consumes one completed receipt, re-verifies every
referenced byte sequence, copies the content-addressed packages, signs the
bounded catalog, and commits the envelope last. It accepts only the compiled
development key identity and loopback origin. The deterministic development
seed in `fixtures/keys` is intentionally public and grants no production trust;
production builds of OverCrow reject it. No production private key, sequence
state, deployment credential, or signing path exists in this repository.

The marketplace website cannot install software. The Control Center validates
packages and user consent; local unverified packages install disabled and stay
disabled until explicitly enabled.

The website and its isolated Studio are maintained separately. Report website or
SDK vulnerabilities through this repository's private vulnerability reporting
entry point, identifying the affected component. Never include widget drafts,
account data, signing keys, or credentials in a report.

If a listed package is suspected of compromise, maintainers may publish a
signed suspension or revocation in a newer monotonic catalog. Clients must
reject that package for new installation or update, immediately disable an
installed copy, and offer its removal. An absent or stale catalog never invents
a revocation. A catalog signature never bypasses package validation, user
consent, or runtime sandboxing. Follow the authoritative
[production operations runbook](docs/production-operations.md) for key
recovery, loss, compromise, suspension, revocation, and corrective rollback.
